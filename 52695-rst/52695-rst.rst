   |  I.

   |  The blessed Damozel leaned out
   |    From the gold bar of Heaven:
   |  Her blue-grey eyes were deeper much
   |    Than a deep water, even.
   |  She had three lilies in her hand,
   |    And the stars in her hair were seven.

.. vspace:: 2

..

   |  II.

   |  Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,
   |    No wrought flowers did adorn,
   |  But a white rose of Mary's gift
   |    On the neck meetly worn;
   |  And her hair, lying down her back,
   |    Was yellow like ripe corn.

   |  III.

   |  Herseemed she scarce had been a day
   |    One of God's choristers;
   |  The wonder was not yet quite gone
   |    From that still look of hers;
   |  Albeit to them she left, her day
   |    Had counted as ten years.

   |  IV.

   |  (To *one* it is ten years of years
   |    . . . Yet now, here in this place,
   |  Surely she leaned o'er me,—her hair
   |    Fell all about my face . . .
   |  Nothing: the Autumn-fall of leaves.
   |    The whole year sets apace.)

   |  It was the terrace of God's house
   |    That she was standing on,—
   |  By God built over the sheer depth
   |    In which Space is begun;
   |  So high, that looking downward thence,
   |    She could scarce see the sun.

   |  It lies from Heaven across the flood
   |    Of ether, as a bridge.
   |  Beneath, the tides of day and night
   |    With flame and blackness ridge
   |  The void, as low as where this earth
   |    Spins like a fretful midge.

   |  But in those tracts, with her, it was
   |    The peace of utter light
   |  And silence.  For no breeze may stir
   |    Along the steady flight
   |  Of seraphim; no echo there,
   |    Beyond all depth or height.

   |  Heard hardly, some of her new friends,
   |    Playing at holy games,
   |  Spake, gentle-mouthed, among themselves,
   |    Their virginal chaste names;
   |  And the souls, mounting up to God,
   |    Went by her like thin flames.

   |  And still she bowed herself, and stooped
   |    Into the vast waste calm;
   |  Till her bosom's pressure must have made
   |    The bar she leaned on warm,
   |  And the lilies lay as if asleep
   |    Along her bended arm.

   |  From the fixt lull of heaven, she saw
   |    Time, like a pulse, shake fierce
   |  Through all the worlds.  Her gaze still strove,
   |    In that steep gulph, to pierce
   |  The swarm: and then she spake, as when
   |    The stars sang in their spheres.

   |  "I wish that he were come to me,
   |    For he will come," she said.
   |  "Have I not prayed in solemn heaven?
   |    On earth, has he not prayed?
   |  Are not two prayers a perfect strength?
   |    And shall I feel afraid?

   |  "When round his head the aureole clings,
   |    And he is clothed in white,
   |  I'll take his hand, and go with him
   |    To the deep wells of light,
   |  And we will step down as to a stream
   |    And bathe there in God's sight.

   |  She gazed, and listened, and then said,
   |    Less sad of speech than mild;

The title of The Lover's Library is sufficiently descriptive
to make explanation of the purpose of the Series almost
unnecessary.

.. vspace:: 1

It is sought to include in a group of compact little volumes
the best Love Poems of the great British poets; and from time
to time a volume of prose, or a volume of modern verse which
may be considered of sufficient importance, will be added to the
Library.

.. vspace:: 1

The delicate decorations, on the pages, end papers, and covers,
make the little books dainty enough for small presents, and it is
hoped that those who do not receive them as presents from others
will seize the opportunity of making presents to themselves.
